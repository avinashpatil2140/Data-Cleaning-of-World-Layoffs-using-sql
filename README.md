The World Layoffs Analysis Project is a comprehensive study of global layoffs, designed to uncover trends, patterns, and insights across industries, companies, and countries. With the increasing impact of economic fluctuations, company restructuring, and global events, understanding workforce reduction patterns is crucial for businesses, analysts, and policymakers.

The project begins with data cleaning and preprocessing using SQL. The raw dataset often contained inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and varied formats across fields such as dates, company names, and locations. SQL queries were employed to standardize the dataset, handle nulls, remove duplicates, and create a structured format suitable for analysis. This step ensures that subsequent analysis is accurate, reliable, and reproducible.

Once the data was cleaned, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed entirely using SQL. Aggregations, counts, averages, and conditional queries were applied to identify key insights, including:

Industries most affected by layoffs

Countries and regions with the highest workforce reductions

Company-specific patterns and trends

Seasonal and temporal trends in layoffs

This project highlights the power of SQL in both data preparation and analysis, demonstrating skills such as data cleaning, aggregation, filtering, and deriving meaningful insights from raw datasets. The findings can be used to inform strategic decisions, understand workforce dynamics, and support predictive analytics for future planning.

The project is ideal for showcasing practical data analytics skills, particularly for beginners and intermediate analysts looking to strengthen their SQL proficiency while working on a real-world, high-impact dataset. Future extensions could include visualization using tools like Tableau or Power BI, or predictive modeling to forecast layoffs trends.
